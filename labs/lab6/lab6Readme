3. My program did not work as I expected when I were trying to make my program more efficient:(

4. I tried to use gdb to figure out why my program works well when I were redirecting the text file into it, but it doesn't work when I were trying to use the keyboard. I did not figured it out yet. However, the problem is occured on reading my keyboard value.

5. gdb were used to confirm the theory that using `xorq %rax, %rax` is does the same thing as `movq $0, %rax` and more efficient.

6. I use gdb to track my jump sequence; However, at most time, when I executed it, seg fault pops up when I did something wrongly.

7. No, I jump between notes and recorded lecutures.
